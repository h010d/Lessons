	<h1>Offline *Only* Viewing</h1>

	<hr>     
	<p>It made the rounds a while back that Chris Bolin built a page of
		his personal website that could only be viewed while you are offline. Now he
	has a whole magazine around this same concept called The Disconnect!</p>

	<p>Wufoo helps you build forms you can put on any website.<b>There's a
	million</b>  reasons you might need to do that, from the humble contact form,
	to a sales lead generation form, to a sales or registration form.

	That's powerful and useful all by itself. But Wufoo is even more powerful when
you consider that it integrates with over 1,000 other web services. </p>

<p>I’ve been playing around with ServiceWorker a lot recently, so when Chris
	asked me to write an article about it I couldn’t have been more thrilled.
	ServiceWorker is the most impactful modern web technology since Ajax.

	<br> It’s an API that lives inside the browser and sits between your web
	pages and your application servers. Once installed and activated, a
	ServiceWorker can programmatically determine how to respond to requests
	for resources from your origin, even when the browser is offline.
	ServiceWorker can be used to power the so-called "Offline First" web.

	ServiceWorker is a progressive technology, and in this article, I'll show
	you how to take a website and make it available offline for humans who are
	using a modern browser while leaving humans with unsupported browsers
unaffected.</p>
